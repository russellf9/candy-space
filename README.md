This is a project for the Gojimo Code Challenge


## Installation

I've used the [healthy-gulp-angular](https://github.com/paislee/healthy-gulp-angular) seed, so follow the same installation instructions:

1. Check out this repository
2. Ensure you have node installed
3. Run `npm install` in the root directory (this will install bower dependencies too)


(The original healthy-gulp-angular README can be found here: [healthy-angular-README.md](healthy-angular-README.md) )

## Running the app

```
$ gulp watch-dev
```
